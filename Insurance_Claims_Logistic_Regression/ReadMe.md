# Project Description

### Project where I analyzed the car_insurance dataset to find the feature that was the best predictor of the claim "outcome".

##### Step 1: Cleaning missing values using mean imputation (both columns with missing values followed a normal distribution) 
##### Step 2: Using Label Encoding to categorize columns with object type values, preparing for model application.
##### Step 3: Running Logistical Regression inside a for loop to store the predicted values for each individual feature in a list.
##### Step 4: Building a confusion matrix, to calculate the accuracy of each predictor and find the feature which was the best predictor of the "outcome" of the claim.
