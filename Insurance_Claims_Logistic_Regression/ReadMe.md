*Project Description

Project where I analyzed the car_insurance dataset, cleared missing using mean (both columns with NA followed normal distribution) and then used Label Encoding to categorize columns with object type values, preparing for model application.
Afterwards, I ran a Logistical Regression inside a for loop to predict values according to each individual feature and find the one that provided the best prediction on the claim "outcome" variable , which was being studied.
